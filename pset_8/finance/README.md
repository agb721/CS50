# CS50 Finance

A website designed to let you register an account to buy and sell virtual stocks using the financial data from IEX API found at https://iexcloud.io/

- finance.db keeps track of the necessary databases (users and transactions)
- application.py runs the Flask application
- helpers.py provides a few helper funcions; training-wheels courtesy of the CS50 team
- layout/HTML files provide the structure of the individual web pages the user navigates

TODO:
- clean up application.py: make code more readable & cut redundancies
- improve on personal features, e.g. drop-down menus, username requirements
- learn more about how to improve the frontend
